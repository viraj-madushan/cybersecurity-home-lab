# Cybersecurity Home Lab

## 🧠 Lab Overview
This is my personal cybersecurity home lab for ethical hacking, penetration testing, and system testing.  
The lab uses multiple virtual machines to simulate real-world scenarios safely.

## 🛠️ Tools & OS Used
- **Kali Linux** – Penetration testing, exploitation, recon  
- **Parrot OS** – Penetration testing, reconnaissance  
- **Metasploit** – Exploitation framework  
- **Windows 7 VM** – Target machine  
- **Ubuntu Server VM** – Target machine for testing configurations

## 🔍 Lab Goals
- Practice network scanning and enumeration  
- Exploit vulnerable services safely  
- Understand attack and defense strategies  
- Apply OSI model knowledge in practical scenarios

## 📸 Screenshots
Screenshots of each attack/exploitation are available in the respective folders.

## 🌐 Network Setup
Check the `network-diagram` folder for a visual representation of VM connections.

## ⚔️ Skills Demonstrated
- Network scanning (Nmap)  
- Vulnerability scanning  
- Exploitation using Metasploit  
- Enumeration and recon  
- Basic firewall and defense strategies
